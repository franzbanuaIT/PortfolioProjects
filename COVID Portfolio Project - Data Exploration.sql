Covid 19 Data Exploration
Raw data was manipulated in MS Excel removing unnecessary columns 
and then created 2 tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations then imported data as Excel(.xlsx files) in SQL Server

SQL skills used: Joins, Aggregate Functions, Sub Queries, CTE's, Temp Tables, 
Windows Functions,  Creating Views, Converting Data Types

The dataset covers from January 01,2020 to November 22, 2022

The updated dataset is available on this link --https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
